# Gaming-Behavior-Matchmaking
A multiplatform online gaming behavioral matchmaking system

 

**Background:**

Online gaming is an enormous industry that grows each year. As the audience for online multiplayer games has gotten bigger, the technology to meaningfully match these players has lagged behind. Often times players, especially in competitive settings, are matched using game metrics and statistics in order to have players of a similar skill caliber play together. As this has become commonplace, players find themselves matched with people who appear only as a username. With a lack of personal connection, some players engage in negative communication which results in a lower quality gaming experience for all.

 

**Project Goal:**

This team project aims to resolve existing matchmaking issues by matching players on criteria beyond simply skill. The end product will collect more information about a player, including parameters related to play-style, preferences and attitude. Thus, it will reintroduce a human component to online teammates and help to brighten a gamer’s horizon with improved gaming experiences. Taking data from in-game sources and crossing it with player and user generated behavior profiles, your prospect system should match players with teammates that suit both their skill and behavior. In addition, your system should enable users to find players from other games, add them as friends, and form groups; all with like-minded players that they find in matchmaking.

 

**Assumptions/Constrains:**

Players want a personal level added to gaming, given that such a system would reduce hostile and volatile communication, also while having teammates of a similar skill factor.
Players would be willing to use a third-party app to match-make across a multitude of games.
The data for player skill and behavior can be used in matchmaking in a timely manner.
While there is much data for matchmaking possible through open-sources API’s, some data may not be accessible and may reduce the capabilities of your system’s ability to match players in certain games.
 

**Requirements:**

You are required to leverage Scrum practice in small teams as you build out a working prototype to address the goal of this project.
The final product may be a Mobile App, Web App or Desktop App with the technology stack of your own choosing.
You are encouraged to talk to gamers and/or gaming professionals to acquire additional application domain knowledge (Rachel Foster as a voluntary client, offers students further insights on requirements/user stories. Get in touch with her if you need to: rfoste42@kennesaw.edu).
The following tools are either required, or have proved very, very useful to previous teams in this course.
Required: a github account 
Required: one of these three project management tools:
Azure DevOps platform (which comes with great Agile tools)--to get started Create a project 
Trello -- a taskboard to help developers and clients manage tasks 
Jira -- another tool.
Recommended: Slack -- a very popular team messaging tool; see the first two chapters of a good tutorial at Tidbits

**Notes (important–make sure to read carefully):**

Each team must designate a Product Owner, responsible for the product vision as well as the content of each sprint, and a Scrum Master responsible for the overall process. All submissions are at team-based level. This means only the Scrum Master from each group will submit the deliverables on the behalf of her/his team. You should communicate with your teammates early and begin working on the project. Make sure you break up the project so that each member of the team has a responsibility. The project is graded at the team level. This means that each team member usually receives the same grade for each such element. However, if a student does not perform at the team level for a given element, that student should NOT expect the same grade as the other team members. This includes both students who choose not to participate to an appropriate degree and those who choose to be “team hero”.
 
Weightage: 50% (team effort) + 20% final presentation
